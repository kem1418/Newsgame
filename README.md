The objective of my News game is to promote kindness and acceptance. Kindness is something that I believe this country is lacking especially as of recently. My game will touch on the topic of immigration. A big focal point of the Trump Administration has been immigration and “building the wall”. Many people that disagree, myself included believe that everyone has the right to a better life and what better way to do it then to come to the United States. 

The game is played by picking up as many people/immigrants as possible to decrease the size of the wall. By decreasing the size of the wall, it represents that immigrants make our country great. Each person on the United States map is depicted as a different color to represent all of the different races and ethnicities of people in this country. How you win this game is by picking up all of the immigrants and making them feel welcomed to this country so they can live the American Dream. By not picking up the immigrants you will lose the game but supporting such discriminatory actions by our politicians. 

This country is the melting pot of the world and it is important that we recognize people that want to create a better life for themselves and their family. I think this is will open the eyes of my peers to recognize what happens if we speak up for what we believe in. We can assist in promoting kindness and acceptance by allowing people to come to America and succeed.
